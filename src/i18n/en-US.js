    'global.home.title': 'A Smart Contract Carrier',
    'global.home.content': 'eRoc, is a public blockchain based on "Edge Consented Asynchronous Smart Contract Partitioning Protocol" and is the fundermental platform for the building and execution of dApps in the future. "eRoc" is the reversion of “Core”, which means that we adhere to create a more open, equal and autonomous platform.',

	'global.home.advantage1.title': 'Ingenious and quick consensus algorithm DRC, secures every transaction and do not miss every business opportunity',
	'global.home.advantage1.content': 'Globally ingenious consensus algorithm DRC for public blockchain: Deterministic-Random Consensus (Patented), which creatively realizes the synthesis of "determinacy" and "randomness". The DRC consensus algorithm is secured and backed by many advanced algorithms and mechanisms including Proof of Work Featuring Outsourcing-Proof. There is no excessive power consumption caused by computation. DRC is real grass-root friendly, with zero-threshold and superior to other consensus algorithms such as PoW and PoS from the perspectives of speed, efficiency, threshold, economy and implication for society.',
	'global.home.advantage2.title': 'Built-in storage sharding mechanism improves storage efficiency significantly, no worry about huge data.',
	'global.home.advantage2.content': 'As a public blockchain, along with more and more transactions are recorded over time, it will face an insurmountable challenge to overcome arise from storage. eRoc has designed an intelligent storage sharding technology (patented) to solve the problem caused by the ever-growth ledger scale of the public blockchain once for all, making the storage bottleneck of massive data no longer a barrier to the development of the public blockchain. It is a one of the few public blockchains that introduce the storage sharding mechanism of data at the very beginning.',
	'global.home.advantage3.title': 'Partitioned smart contract execution satisfies the peak throughput requirement',
	'global.home.advantage3.content': 'The partitioned smart contract execution mechanism of eRoc is completely based on self-conceived technology. This mechanism partitions live nodes to forms multiple centers. Each center executes different smart contracts simultaneously. With the introduction of NLP (Node Level Parallelism), the efficiency of smart contract execution has been significantly improved, so has the throughput of the system. The partitioned smart contract execution mechanism along with the DRC makes the eRoc system have controllable computing competition and efficient system performance, and achieves perfect Nash equilibrium amongst system efficiency, competitive pressure and system security.',
	'global.home.advantage4.title': 'Microkernel design enables the customization for vertical usages',
	'global.home.advantage4.content': "Intel modularized the computer so that everyone can assemble their own computers like building blocks. Modularization is a key step for computers to enter thousands of families. eRoc makes blockchains quickly adapt to the needs of various industries by using microkernel technology. The blockchain formally enters the era of personalized assembly. Microkernel is a reduced set of functions that forms the core part of the public blockchain system. The microkernel only includes the core functions, such as the ledger storage, the consensus and the smart contract scheduling. The other system services such as node management, account system, security system and so on are implemented as system smart contracts. The microkernel design ensure that the system is flexible, robust and scalable.",
	'global.home.advantage5.title': 'Multiple-languages supports lower the threshold of decentralized app development',
	'global.home.advantage5.content': "eRoc supports the use of mainstream development languages to develop smart contracts. eRoc blockchain will support Java, JavaScript, Go, C++ and other mainstream languages to develop smart contracts, covering 99% of the world's developers, thus lays a solid foundation for the future ecosystem development of the public blockchain.",
	'global.home.advantage6.title': 'Full decentralization reassure the trust-building over trustless',
	'global.home.advantage6.content': "Bitcoin is becoming more and more centralized on block issuing, so as to the Ethereum. The super node concept is centralized by design. Centralization faces many potential dangers such as vulnerability to attacks. In order to fully make use of the advantages of decentralization, eRoc blockchain adhere to decentralization, and avoid the challenges caused by centralization by applying DRC, PoWFOP and other supportive technologies.",
