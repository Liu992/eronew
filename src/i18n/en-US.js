    'global.home.content': 'eRoc, is a public blockchain based on "Edge Consented Asynchronous Smart Contract Partitioning Protocol" and is the fundermental platform for the building and execution of dApps in the future. "eRoc" is the reversion of “Core”, which means that we adhere to create a more open, equal and autonomous platform.',

	'global.home.advantage1.content': 'Global original chain of decentralized public Consensus algorithm DRC: certainty Random Consensus mechanism (Deterministic - the Random Consensus, hereinafter referred to as DRC, had applied for patent), creative implementation of the "uncertainty", "Random" the mixture of the two incompatible things. DRC consensus algorithm, by not outsourcing work proof mechanism (PoWFOP) and so on many advanced algorithms and mechanism to guarantee and implementation, without too much power consumption problems, real and common zero threshold, from the speed, efficiency, threshold, economy, social significance, such as Angle is superior to the POW, POS, DPOS consensus algorithm, etc.',
	'global.home.advantage2.title': 'Built-in storage sharding mechanism improves storage efficiency significantly',
	'global.home.advantage2.content': 'As a public chain, with time, more and more data, storage faces a huge challenge. EROC unique intelligent shard type storage technology (has applied for patent), solved once and for all the male chain data growing problems, making huge amounts of data storage is no longer a bottleneck and the barriers in the development of chain and become a few established in long-term storage is introduced at the beginning of data management mechanism on the scarce of public chain.',
	'global.home.advantage3.title': 'Partitioned smart contract execution satisfies the peak throughput requirement',
	'global.home.advantage3.content': 'The asynchronous sharding execution mechanism of advanced intelligent contract based entirely on own technology, which implements intelligent sharding for the nodes of the whole network and forms multi-center. Each sub-center executes different smart contracts simultaneously. By means of node level parallelism, the execution efficiency of intelligent contract is greatly improved and the system throughput is enhanced.',

	'global.home.advantage4.content': "eRoc has a unique microkernel architecture. Microkernel (Micro Kernel) is to provide public chain system core features compact set, it put a chain of male's core function implemented in the form of contract system intelligence, improve the flexibility of the entire system, robustness and scalability.",
	'global.home.advantage5.title': 'Multiple-languages supports lower the threshold of decentralized app development',
	'global.home.advantage5.content': "eRoc supports an intelligent contract development system for more developers. The eRoc public chain will support the development of intelligent contracts in mainstream languages such as Java, JavaScript, Go and C++. It has covered 99% of the world's developers and laid a solid foundation for the future ecological development of the public chain.",
	'global.home.advantage6.title': 'Full decentralization reassure the trust-building over trustless',
	'global.home.advantage6.content': "The super node election of block chain makes it open to centralization. However, the trend of blockchain centralization will bring many hidden dangers such as vulnerability to attack. In order to fully enjoy the benefits of decentralization, EROC public chain adheres to the direction of decentralization, and meanwhile, DRC, PoWFOP and other technologies are adopted to solve the challenges brought by decentralization.",
